# An-interace-to-facilitate-dealing-with-data-for-datascience
this project for dealing with data such as collecting the data ,remove the null value , change some values , explore the column and find the correlaition between the columns ,building models ,test and fit the new data using an interface just without any coding 
The project contains  five interfaces:
## 1. An interface to upload the train data and the data that I want to fit  in the trained model

## 2. An interface to modify values and deal with null values

## 3. An interface to explore the data through graphs with the ability to save the drawing

## 4. An interface to explore the correlation between the data columns and display it by a graph and the ability to save the graph

## 5. An interface for selecting the algorithm to be applied, building a model, entering the data to be applied on the model , and extracting the output of this data as an Excel file
